PROMPT START

You are building a hackathon-winning full-stack dApp for the Linera Microchains hackathon.

Product

Build CricChain: a real-time “cricket prediction market / live match predictions” demo with microchains.
Users can:

Create a prediction (question + options + close time)

Vote on an option (on-chain)

See live updates (real-time UI)

See outcome + final stats after close time

View “My Predictions” and “My Votes” dashboard

Admin tools (optional): close prediction, resolve outcome

MUST-HAVE Hackathon Requirements

Working demo with no broken links and no “doesn’t connect to testnet” issues.

Linera integration is real: read/write calls to a deployed Linera application (Conway testnet).

If real chain connection fails, implement a demo-safe fallback:

“Mock Mode” switch that runs the same UI against a local in-memory API so the demo never breaks.

Show a clear banner: “Mock Mode / On-chain Mode”

Must be deployable on Vercel with zero configuration errors.

Provide a clean README with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting.

Provide a Submission Kit folder:

SUBMISSION.md (what it does, problem, solution, how it works, Linera usage, architecture, roadmap)

DEMO_SCRIPT.md (2–3 min judge demo script)

PITCH.md (short pitch)

screenshots/ placeholders

Tech Constraints

Use Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, lucide-react.

Use clean architecture:

/app UI

/lib linera client wrapper + API adapter

/app/api route handlers (server)

Do NOT require Linera CLI for the demo to run.

All config must come from environment variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID

NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUCET_URL default to https://faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net

UI/UX Quality (must look premium)

Home landing with hero, tagline, animated cards, and “Connect & Start” CTA

Dashboard layout (left sidebar + main content)

Prediction creation wizard (stepper)

Live predictions list with filters (Live / Closing Soon / Resolved)

Each prediction has a detail page with:

option cards

vote button

vote distribution chart

activity feed (“new vote came in…”)

Use tasteful gradients, spacing, responsive design, dark mode.

Include loading skeletons, toasts, empty states, error states.

Add small “wow factor”: micro-animations, transitions, real-time update feel.

Linera Integration Approach

Implement a wrapper lib/linera.ts that:

Initializes the Linera web client safely (browser-only, SSR safe).

Exposes functions:

createPrediction(question, options, closeTime)

listPredictions()

getPrediction(id)

vote(predictionId, optionIndex)

resolve(predictionId, winningOption)

These should call the smart contract via Linera client (GraphQL or supported web client calls).

If connection fails, automatically switch to Mock Mode and keep app functional.

Deliverables

Working app with npm install && npm run dev

npm run build must pass (Vercel safe)

Add vercel.json only if necessary

Add .env.example

Add robust error handling and logs

Provide sample seed predictions in Mock Mode so UI looks full on first run

Create the entire project in the current Replit workspace. Ensure no missing imports, no broken routes, no build-time errors.
